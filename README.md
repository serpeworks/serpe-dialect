The MAVLink protocol is designed to facilitate communication between drones within a Ground Control System (GCS) network. The protocol is structured to ensure that strategic decisions are centralized, giving the GCS authority over the network while maintaining flexibility and clarity in communication. This protocol does not directly control drone actuators but focuses on the high-level management of drone operations within the network.
